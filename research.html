	<h3>From integrative metabolomics to understanding human diseases and enhancing CO<sub>2</sub> utilization</h3>
	<p><span class="image right"><img src="/images/research01.png" alt="" /></span>A growing concern for 21st-century humanity is the irrevocable rise of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). On a more personal level, many individuals today suffer from distressing diseases like cancer. Potential solutions to these disparate problems lie in metabolism. With these applications in mind, our research goal is to advance biotechnology and medicine by integrative metabolomics, which incorporates kinetic and thermodynamic information into characterization of metabolic processes.</p>
	<p style="position:relative;"><a name="co2_fixation" style="position:absolute; top:-100px;"></a><a class="para" href="co2_fixation">Our research has focused on enhancing CO<sub>2</sub> utilization by employing thermodynamic and systems-level efficiency of non-photosynthetic carbon-fixing metabolism. We developed a rapid CO<sub>2</sub> fixation scheme that enables precise control over the rate of CO<sub>2</sub> fixation (i.e., productivity) and the proportion of CO<sub>2</sub> incorporated into the product (i.e., yield). Using this technology, fermentation of <i>Moorella thermoacetica</i> produced acetate as a product of CO<sub>2</sub> fixation at high specific productivities (0.54 g per g cell dry weight (gCDW) per hour) with nearly all acetate carbons (>98%) derived from CO<sub>2</sub>.</a></p>
	<p style="position:relative;"><a name="integrative_metabolomics" style="position:absolute; top:-100px;"></a><a class="para" href="integrative_metabolomics">In establishing this technology, we benefited from quantitative characterization of metabolism. Using non-equilibrium thermodynamic principles and stoichiometric metabolic models, We were able to integrate forward-to-backward reaction flux ratios with reaction quotient-to-equilibrium constant ratios via Gibbs free energy. The upshot of the integrative analysis was internally consistent and comprehensive sets of metabolite concentrations and Gibbs energies in <i>E. coli</i>, yeast, and mammalian cells. Based on these results, we found efficient enzyme usage to be a design principle across kingdoms of life.</a></p>
	<p style="position:relative;"><a name="human_diseases" style="position:absolute; top:-100px;"></a><a class="para" href="human_diseases">We recognized that there is ample room for new discoveries by applying the integrative metabolomic approaches in other fields. Collaborating with researchers in various fields, we contributed to understanding the underlying metabolic processes in bacterial persistence and in healthy embryonic development. The resulting knowledge pointed to potential drug targets in bacteria with high antibiotic tolerance and to an essential metabolic regulation that ensures normal development.</a></p>
	<p>Going forward, we would like to incorporate comprehensive enzyme cost and efficiency information into the metabolic flux and pathway analysis paradigm. Lack of efficiency in certain cells (e.g., cancer cells) could suggest potential therapeutic targets. In metabolic engineering applications, the economics of cellular proteome partitioning must be compatible with our economic goals. Optimal and feasible solutions, then, would consist of metabolic modules that simultaneously permit maximum enzyme efficiency and maximum net value created. Such integrative approaches will help disentangle complex metabolic diseases and engineering challenges, thereby facilitating better therapeutic and engineering solutions.</p>

	<p>Teaching and research complement each other. Without proper training of young scientists, the future of research looks bleak. Oftentimes, new unanswered questions arise from teaching and current research findings enrich the teaching component. In both settings, the importance of interdisciplinary and collaborative problem solving cannot be overstated. Many of my research projects have been fruitful collaborative efforts involving several disciplines and I can readily apply my experience to my teaching.</p>
	<p>My teaching goals also include promoting curiosity and encouraging the endeavor to pursue new knowledge and experience. From my experience teaching in lectures, discussion and laboratory sessions as well as mentoring students, I learned that, aside from answering students’ questions, I also have to ask them the ‘right’ questions to engage their minds. These questions could be laid out to guide students to solve problems on their own and eventually to render them more inquisitive. I would like to incorporate my teaching principles and goals into chemical and biological engineering core courses as well as new electives that introduce students to interdisciplinary/integrative problem solving.</p>
